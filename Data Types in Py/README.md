# Chapter 3: Numeric Data Types, Booleans, and Sets

## Numeric Data Types
Overview of numeric data types such as integers and floats, including their operations and conversions.

## Booleans - The Logical Data Type
Explanation of boolean values (`True` and `False`), and their role in logical operations and conditional statements.

## Sets (Unordered Data with Optimized Logic Operations)
Introduction to sets, their unique properties, and how they are used for efficient logic operations and membership testing.

# Chapter 4: Advanced Data Types

## Counting Made Easy
Techniques and tools for efficiently counting occurrences of elements in data structures.

## Dictionaries of Unknown Structure - Defaultdict
Using `defaultdict` to simplify dictionary handling when the structure of data is unknown or varies.

## What Do You Mean I Don't Have Any Class? Namedtuple
Introduction to `namedtuple`, providing a way to create simple classes for storing data with named fields.

## Data Classes
Overview of data classes, their advantages over regular classes, and how they simplify the creation of class instances with default values and type annotations.
